Pseudocode in words

1) Read the championship year
2) if the year is smaller/equal to 2002 then:
3) Set the variable matchday to 0
4) Read season/matchday
5) if matchday is smaller/equal to 30 then:
6) set hometeam to Brage**** (selection of one team)
7) set  the variable joypoints to 0
8) if the hometeam's goals are more than the awayteam's
9) we give a new value to our variable by adding 5 to it (joypoint + 5)
10) if not we add to its value 0
27)else set variable matchday to matchday+1
11) And set hometeam goals to 0
12) if  the goals of the hometeam are more than 0
13) Then add this number to the variable's value
14) else add 0 to it.
15) Set joypoints as the sum of (joypoints + hometeamgoals)
16) Write the number of the (final)value of the variable joypoints
17) If the value joypoints is >= 300
18) Then write "(selected team) made its fans very super joyous!"
19) Else if the value joypoints is <= 299 and >=250
20) Then write "(selected team) made its fans enough joyous!" 
21) Else if the value joypoints is <= 249 and >=150
22) Then write "(selected team) made its fans joyous on average!" 
23) Else if the value joypoints is <= 149 and >=100
24) Then write "(selected team) offered a pour amount of joy to  its fans!"
25) Else if the value joypoints is <100  
26) Write "(selected team) made their fans to feel miserable!"
28)else write "not available data range"
