## Superettan 2011-2015
Who said football can't be fun?

## About
JoyPoints is a project created as a part of our course assignment.
The project's goal is to find out how much of a joy can football offer to it's fans!
To prove this to you, we chose the Superettan league (Swedish football).
Of course, you can all check this out at our website: [JoyPoints](https://stavitsik.github.io/JoyPoints/).

## Credits
This project was the original idea of Kostas Soulos (yakadaneau), creator of our hml file and pseudocode.
This Repository was created by Stavroula Tsikopoulou, also responsible for the README file and the People Page.
Jessica CL follows as our text editor and logo creator.
Last but also with a very responsible and demanding role is Fikru Ayalkibet, our html and website designer!
Even though we had our own separate roles, we all contributed to each other's work and made sure it was as successful as possible.

Enjoy!
